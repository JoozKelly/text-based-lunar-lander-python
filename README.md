# Lunar Lander ðŸš€

Welcome, astronaut! This project is a classic text-based **Lunar Lander game** written in Python. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to safely pilot the lunar module to the moon's surface. This game is a great example of a simple physics simulation and a classic command-line interface.

## Project Requirements
This game is designed to run in a standard Python environment. All you need is a working installation of **Python 3**. No external libraries are necessary, making it easy to run on any system.

---

## Dependencies
This project has **no external dependencies**. It's built entirely using Python's standard library, which means you don't need to install any additional packages with `pip`.
