# Lunar Lander ðŸš€

Welcome, astronaut! This project is a classic text-based **Lunar Lander game** written in Python. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to safely pilot the lunar module to the moon's surface. This game is a great example of a simple physics simulation and a classic command-line interface.

---

## Project Requirements
This game is designed to run in a standard Python environment. All you need is a working installation of **Python 3**. No external libraries are necessary, making it easy to run on any system.

---

## Dependencies
This project has **no external dependencies**. It's built entirely using Python's standard library, which means you don't need to install any additional packages with `pip`.

---

## Getting Started
To get the game up and running, all you have to do is save the code to a file and run it directly from your terminal.

1.  Save the code provided in `lunar_lander.py`.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

---

## How to Run the Application
Once you've saved the file, you can start the game with a single command.

```bash
python lunar_lander.py

Relevant Code Examples
The core game logic is contained within the lunar_lander() function. Here's a look at the two key calculations that drive the simulation.

Calculating New Flight Data
The while loop is the heart of the game, updating the module's state on each turn. The speed and altitude are adjusted based on gravity and your chosen burn rate.

Python

# Calculating New Flight Data
altitude -= speed # same as altitude = altitude - speed
speed += gravity - burn/10
fuel -= burn
Checking the Landing Outcome
After the module's altitude drops to zero, the game checks your final landing conditions. If your speed is too high, you crash; otherwise, you've landed safely.

Python

# Display Good Landing or Not
if altitude <- 5 or speed > 5:
    print("You have crashed...")
else:
    print("You have landed!")
Conclusion
This Lunar Lander game is a fantastic demonstration of a straightforward yet engaging command-line application. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in game development, physics simulations, or learning the fundamentals of Python. Have fun, and be sure to land softly! ðŸŒ•

This video provides an excellent example of how to build a similar lunar lander game from scratch in Python.
